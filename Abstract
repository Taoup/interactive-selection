We propose a novel approach which combines Deep Convolutional Neural Network with grabcut-like user interaction to
tackle the interactive object segmentation problem. Slightly deviating from grabcut user interaction, our method uses
box and clicks. In addition, our proposed architecture follows the modulisation design principle. To be more specific,
our architecture is composed of two subnetworks, SBox-Net and
Click-Net, processing box and clicks respectively. SBox-Net was designed to be a heavy-weight, full-fledged segmentation
network that is built up upon pretrained, state-of-the-art segmentation model, while Click-Net is a simple yet powerful
network that utilizes pyramid feature maps extracted from SBox-Net and user clicks to correct the mistakes made by SBox-Net.  The proposed
modulized design of our architecture has many advantages over existing methods, which are detailed in following sections.
Our proposed method achieved accuracy on par with the state-of-the-art method while significantly mitigate the burdon
of users. Comprehensive evaluations are made on various challenging datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
